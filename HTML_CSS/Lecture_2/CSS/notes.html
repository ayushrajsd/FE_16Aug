    <h1>Combinators</h1>
    <p>
      In CSS, combinators are used to select HTML elements based on their
      relationship to other elements. Combinators allow you to create more
      specific and targeted CSS selectors by specifying the relationship between
      different elements in the HTML structure. There are four types of
      combinators in CSS:
    </p>
    <h2>Descendant Combinator</h2>
    <p>Descendant Combinator (space): Selects an element that is a descendant of another specified element. It matches any element that is inside the specified element, no matter how deeply nested.
        Example:
        div p {
          /* Selects <p> elements that are descendants of <div> elements */
        }
        </p>
    <h2>Child(Immediate) combinators</h2>
    <p>Child Combinator (>): Selects an element that is a direct child of another specified element. It matches only if the second element is an immediate child of the first element.
        Example:
        
        ul > li {
          /* Selects li elements that are direct children of ul elements */
        }
        </p>
    <h2>Adjacent Sibling Combinators</h2>
    <p>Adjacent Sibling Combinator (+): Selects an element that is the immediate next sibling of another specified element. It matches only if the second elemen`	t comes immediately after the first element.
        Example:
        h2 + p {
          /* Selects p elements that come immediately after h2 elements */
        }
        </p>
    <h2>General Sibling (~)</h2>
    <p>General Sibling Combinator (~): Selects elements that are siblings of another specified element and come after it. It matches any element that is a sibling of the first element, as long as it appears after the first element.</p>
    <p>h3 ~ p {
        /* Selects p elements that are siblings of h3 elements and appear after them */
      }
      </p>
